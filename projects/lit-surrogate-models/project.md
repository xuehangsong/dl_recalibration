# Project: lit-surrogate-models

## Goal
Literature review on surrogate models for groundwater contamination simulation

## Scope
- Deep learning surrogates: U-Net, FNO, U-FNO, DeepONet, Transformer
- Classical surrogates: Gaussian Process, RBF, Polynomial Chaos
- Hybrid and physics-informed surrogates
- Compare accuracy, speed, applicability

## Context
- Part of dl_recalibration mega-project
- Your manuscript already has strong coverage - expand it
- Must meet: 50+ papers, 20+ from 2015-2025

## Framework
- Scout Framework (PM management)
- hydro-lit workflow (literature extraction)

## Topics to Cover
1. U-Net / CNN-based surrogates
2. Fourier Neural Operators (FNO, U-FNO)
3. DeepONet and operator learning
4. Transformer-based models
5. Gaussian Process surrogates
6. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN)
7. Hybrid/fusion approaches
