# Project Context

## Latest Run

- **Date**: 2025-02-25
- **Run #**: 1
- **Status**: Completed

## Summary

Completed comprehensive literature review on data assimilation methods for groundwater modeling:

- **Papers reviewed**: 50+
- **Papers from 2015-2025**: 25+
- **Topics covered**: ESMDA, EnKF, 4D-Var, particle filters, surrogate-assisted DA, UQ

## Generated Files

1. **papers.md** - Annotated bibliography with 50+ papers organized by topic
2. **synthesis.md** - 4,200+ word synthesis covering all major DA methods
3. **knowledge.yaml** - Structured knowledge base for dl_recalibration project

## Key Findings

1. ESMDA (Emerick & Reynolds, 2013) is well-established for groundwater inverse problems
2. Deep learning surrogates enable practical DA for large-scale problems
3. Iterative ensemble smoothers (EnRML, PEST++ IES) provide efficient optimization
4. Uncertainty quantification integral to decision support applications
5. Hybrid methods combining ensemble and variational approaches emerging

## Next Steps

Results ready for dl_recalibration manuscript integration. ESMDA methods documented in detail.
