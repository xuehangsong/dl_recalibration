# Project: lit-drift-detection

## Goal
Literature review on drift detection and recalibration triggers for ML/ surrogate models in environmental modeling

## Scope
- Concept drift detection methods
- Recalibration triggers in ML/Deep Learning
- Monitoring strategies for model performance degradation
- Active learning for model updating

## Context
- Part of dl_recalibration mega-project
- **Core novelty** of your framework
- Must integrate with hydro-lit workflow

## Framework
- Scout Framework (PM management)
- hydro-lit workflow (literature extraction)
